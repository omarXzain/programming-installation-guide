### Please open your Terminal and run the following commands one after another to install the MongoDB client and server:


```
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-5.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
```
sudo apt-get install gnupg
```
```
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/5.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list
```
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```

After installation completes, weâ€™ll need to setup MongoDB as a **service** so that it can easily be restarted. Enter the following commands, in order, to set this up:

```
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongo/master/debian/init.d -o /etc/init.d/mongod
```
```
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/mongod
```
```
sudo service mongod start
```

**Note that: On Ubuntu Linux**, mongo will now automatically restart on every reboot.


 **Run the following command in your Ubuntu Linux to start mongo console.**

```
mongo
```

you will see something similar to this:

`````
