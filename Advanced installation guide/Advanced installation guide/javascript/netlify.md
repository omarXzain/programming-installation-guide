# Cloud Service Providers - Netlify

From now on, in this advanced course, we will use various cloud service providers to deploy code. 
In these steps, we will get a Netlify account created and install command-line tools.

## Netlify
Create an account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Simply “Login with GitHub” and your account will be created and connected to GitHub
Install the CLI tools, by running this command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```
Confirm proper installation
```
netlify --version
```
You should see a version number, such as :

``netlify-cli/9.6.4 wsl-x64 node-v14.2.0``
